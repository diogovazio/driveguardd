HP 3D DriveGuide Daemon for HP notebooks

Usage: Copy:

driveguardd.py to /usr/local/bin/driveguardd 
conf/driveguardd.conf to /etc
init.d/driveguardd to /etc/init.d

Logging goes to syslog. Syntax is compatible with python3 and its the default

And for Ubuntu/Debian users, update-rc.d driveguardd defaults

Thanks: A lot of things i did may not happen w/o Ricardo Canale <ricardo.canale@usp.br> and his mother concerning Notebook Donation ;)
